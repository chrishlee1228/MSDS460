For the brewery case, we can solve for a minimum-cost plan for shipping across breweries, packaging facilities, and demand points. We aggregate data across products to show the minimum and maximum quantities of beer that can be produced at each brewery, minimum and maximum quantities that can be processed at packaging facilities, and quantities on order at demand points. We simplify the problem by summing quantities and averaging costs across beer types (ale and lager) and container/packaging types.\n",

Note that the case presented here is a simplification of the complete brewery case, as we are considering total liquid being shipped from one location to another.

Regardless, the aggregate liquid values used in this assignment are consistent with data for the complete brewery case. \n",

    "# Total transportation/shipping costs depend on the number of units shipped across each of 57 paths between locations: 12 paths between breweries and packaging facilities, and 45 paths between packaging facilities and demand points. The objective of supply chain optimization is to minimize total transportation costs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this supply chain optimization problem, let's consider using a Python program that draws on the PuLP package for mathematical programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our program, let's include a multiplier for demand, so we can see how demand affects the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output from the supply chain optimization should include optimal numbers of units of beer product to be shipped across each of the 57 paths between locations. We should also review counts for total units of production from each of the four brewery locations and each of the three packaging facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this assignment, review the program output and answer these five questions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Solve the supply chain optimization problem with initial settings of parameters for brewing, packaging, and demand. Describe the solution by providing the total cost (minimum cost) and quantities of beer being shipped between each pair of locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Due to low demand for its products, the brewing company is thinking about closing any brewing location that is operating at minimum capacity. Reviewing the solution to the optimization problem, which brewery would you close (if any)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Due to low demand, the company may also want to close one of its packaging facilities. Which packaging facility would you close (if any)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Try multiplying demand by 2, 3, 4, or higher multiples. You can do this by modifying one line of the Python program. You can see the initial setting: demand_multiplier = 1  Setting the multiplier to 2, 3, 4, or higher values, will increase the level of demand, which will change the optimal solution. At what point does demand exceed the company's production capacity? At this point (full capacity), would you close any of the breweries or packaging facilities? \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) What have you learned from this supply chain optimization problem? Explain how you might apply methods of constrained optimization in your line of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Distribution Planning for a Brewery case represents a constrained optimization problem (more specifically, a transshipment problem in mathematical programming). We are minimizing costs subject to production and demand constraints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to approach a transshipment problem would be to consider the network structure across nodes for the breweries, packaging facilities, and demand points. We could vary shipping distances, times, or costs across paths (edges/links) between locations. A discrete event simulation could be used to trace the flow of beer products from node to node. A common discrete event simulation would model the transshipment problem as a network of queues. In week 7, we introduce discrete event simulation.\n",
